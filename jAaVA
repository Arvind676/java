Introduce yourself:

"Good morning/afternoon! My name is Arvind Sai, and I’m from Hyderabad. I’m currently in my final 
semester of B.Tech in the Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) department at St. Martin's
 Engineering College. 
 I completed my intermediate education at Sri Chaitanya Junior College, where I scored 89%, and my 
 SSC at St. Claret High School, securing 95%.

During my academic journey, I developed an interest in programming and learned Java, which has 
significantly improved my coding and analytical skills. As part of my academic work, I also 
undertook a project titled "QRS detection algorithm with adaptive time and amplitude thresholding 
for the Indian healthcare system." 
I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and commitment to a company like
Accenture, where I can grow professionally while contributing to innovative projects.
