Introduce yourself:

"Good morning/afternoon! My name is Arvind Sai, and I’m from Hyderabad. I’m currently in my final 
semester of B.Tech in the Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) department at St. Martin's
 Engineering College. 
 I completed my intermediate education at Sri Chaitanya Junior College, where I scored 89%, and my 
 SSC at St. Claret High School, securing 95%.

During my academic journey, I developed an interest in programming and learned Java, which has 
significantly improved my coding and analytical skills. As part of my academic work, I also 
undertook a project titled "QRS detection algorithm with adaptive time and amplitude thresholding 
for the Indian healthcare system." 
I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and commitment to a company like
Accenture, where I can grow professionally while contributing to innovative projects.

What are ur Strenghts :

One of my key strengths is my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies.And another 
strength is - my ability to work effectively in teams.During group projects, I make sure to 
communicate clearly and listen to others’ ideas, which helps us come up with better solutions.

What are ur weaknesses:

 one weakness I’ve recognized is that I tend to spend too much time playing PUBG and on social media,
 which sometimes distracts me from my studies or other responsibilities. However, I’ve started 
 setting clear limits on my screen time by using productivity apps and creating a more structured 
 daily schedule. I also prioritize my tasks and ensure that work comes first. 
 
 
 
 Why Do u Want to join Accenture:
 
  I want to join Accenture because of its reputation as a global leader in consulting and technology 
  services. I admire how the company blends innovation with delivering measurable business value to
  its clients. 
  and I believe being part of such a forward-thinking organization will allow me to grow both 
  professionally and personally."
